//! Anonymous usage statistics, shared by every mayorana desktop app.
//!
//! The download logs on mayorana.ch can say how many people fetched a build and
//! how many copies checked for an update. They cannot say whether a download
//! became an install, or whether a person who installed last week is still
//! here. This answers those, and only those: an install's first launch, its
//! launches after that, and whether an offered update was taken.
//!
//! What is sent is deliberately narrow, and the narrowness is enforced by the
//! types rather than by care: an [`Event`] is an enum with no free-form fields
//! except an update's target version, which is checked to look like a version
//! before it is kept. There is no way to hand it a path, a file name, a
//! document, an account or an error string.
//!
//! On by default (opt-out), but never before the person has been told: nothing
//! is recorded until the notice has been shown once ([`mark_informed`]).
//! Any one of these means nothing is recorded and nothing is sent:
//!
//!   * the build has no endpoint (`MAYORANA_TELEMETRY_URL` unset at compile
//!     time — which is every `cargo run`, so development never pollutes the
//!     numbers);
//!   * the person turned it off;
//!   * `DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK`, `DO_NOT_TRACK` or `MAYORANA_NO_TELEMETRY` is set,
//!     in the app's environment or in the login shell's (see [`start`]).
//!
//! Best-effort throughout, like the update check: recording is a synchronous
//! append that cannot fail visibly, sending has a two-second timeout, and a
//! failed send leaves the events queued for the next attempt. Never panics,
//! never blocks the interface.
//!
//! Transport is a single GET to a URL on mayorana.ch that answers 204 and
//! nothing else. The batch rides in the query string, base64url-encoded, and
//! the statistics job reads it back out of the web server's access log — the
//! same place it already reads download counts from. A URL has a ceiling, so
//! a backlog goes out as several small requests (see `EVENTS_BUDGET_BYTES`).
//!
//! Identity is one random 128-bit value per app, generated on first use. It is
//! not derived from the machine, the account or the network, so it cannot be
//! recomputed, and a reinstall is a new install. It is deliberately not linked
//! to a mayorana.ch sign-in.
//!
//! This file is the same in every app except for `APP`; gitagent has its own,
//! richer version. Fix a bug here, fix it in all of them.
